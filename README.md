- **Edit Tasks**: Double-click on a task to open a pop-up and edit it.
- **Remove Tasks**: Easily remove tasks from the list.
- **Clear All**: Clear all tasks at once.
- **Responsive Interface**: Simple and clean design with a fixed-size window.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
